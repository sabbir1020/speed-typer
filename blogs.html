        <p>
          Local storage is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger
          amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the
          browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the
          user will need to access later, such as offline data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for
          the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the
          user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data
          that is sensitive, such as login credentials.

          2. how to difference between Global scope and block scope in
          javascript
        </h1>
        <p>
          Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch
          conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that
          particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared
          inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that
          contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side
          JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which
          all the code is being executed

        <h1>3. What is javascript event loop</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is
          responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events,
          and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
          models in other languages like C and Java.
